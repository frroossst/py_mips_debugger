# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Have Python 3.10 or higher installed
- Have pip3 installed

### Installing dependencies

while you are in the root of your project run:  
    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

> NOTE: on some installations it is simply pip, while others use pip3

Currently there are only three dependencies:
- `pyQt5`
- `termcolor`
- `toml`

This project could probably do without termcolor but, for now, it is fine as it is.
