# Introduction

This is general documentation for my MIPS emulator written in Python.

# Goals

- Cross-platform
- Minimal binary size
- Make debugging the MIPS assembly language easier than what QtSpim offers
- Minimal dependencies 

# Limitations
- A minimal emulator for the MIPS assembly language that uses the University of Saskatchewan's CMPT 215, class as a baseline for what features are supported
