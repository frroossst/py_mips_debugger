# Goals

- A minimal MIPS interpreter in Python, (usask's CMPT 215 as a reference for what is supported)
- Less than 5 megabyte
- Make debugging easier
- Ensure compatibility with VSCode using the inbuilt Python DAP
- Reinvent parts of the wheel as needed, rather than the whole
- Minimal installation and dependencies, tiny executable
