- use fixedints
- figure out memory layout and file IO
- figure out a program counter of sorts
- impl file change watcher  (does not work for some reason)
- add a watch panel, where users can specify the debugger to stop when a register changes or when a certain 
    condition is met like $t0 < 9 or $t0 == $a1
- add help for limitations and license
